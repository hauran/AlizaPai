	description:'This is the largest civic engagement project in the country, with millions of students participating in a digital mock election. I produced its new interactive site, with innovative resources for students and educators.',
	challenge:'How do we translate enthusiasm and participation in the Mock Election into continued civic engagement throughout the year? Once students vote and see the election results, how do we keep them coming back to the site and having their voices heard?',
	strategy:'I created a pinterest-like space where classrooms share their photos and stories about their Mock Election, thus channeling enthusiasm from the election past into the current conversation. I also developed content for a Student Projects page that keeps students engaged in political thought, post election time. Activities such as “Find Jeremy a Job” and “No Issue Stands Alone” inspire students to think deeply about nuanced topics and brainstorm their own solutions.',

	description:'This online reading platform needed to be repositioned for its main users. I spearheaded research with its target audience to deliver design and functionality recommendations.',
	challenge:'Pearson Foundation wasn’t sure about how to invest in the site to prepare for upcoming event that would bring more traffic. I realized that while WeGiveBooks.org had an amazing product to share - children’s books for reading and exploring for free online – the site design and features were being driven by marketing rather than user needs.  How can I convince stakeholders that listening and responding to users is the best way to increase the site’s popularity, traffic and success?',
	strategy:'I spearheaded a qualitative user study to understand the target users motivations, use patterns and current limitations. I showed stakeholders how simple improvements such as a better search function and a more intuitive reading interface would increase user engagement & retention. By timing these improvements with the high-traffic event, we attracted new users and developed a loyal base.',

	description:'This interactive DVD takes toddlers on a learning and moving Backyardigans adventure. I scripted and produced over 45 minutes of original animation intermixed with photography and video footage.',
	challenge:'Toddlers were expected to interact with the DVD by pushing buttons on LeapFrog’s new Little Leaps console, but users this young can’t be expected to follow verbal cues. I wanted to deliver instructions that were clear and intuitive but didn’t break out of the fantasy world of The Backyardigans.',
	strategy:'The look of console reminded me of the dashboard of an airplane. So I embarked upon an airplane theme for the story plot, enabling an onscreen representation identical to the console in front of the child. Our animators created a reusable sequence from the viewpoint of the pilots asking "you," the user, to help the plane land or takeoff by moving the joystick or pushing a button. User testing showed that these visual cues motivated toddlers to interact with the console and become active participants in adventure.',

	description:'LeapFrog is famous for its educational books that bring stories to life with dialogue, songs, games and personalized learning modes. I designed the content, interaction and produced award-winning books for young readers.',
	challenge:"My over-arching challenge, through all book titles, was to use technology in a way that enhanced children's imaginations rather than restricted them to a prescribed experience.",
	strategy:'I went beyond the user sessions required by LeapFrog and met with young users as much as schedule and budget would allow. In testing, I never told kids what to do, but rather learned from all the unexpected ways they would interact with the prototypes. As a result, my books were known for their engaging content and intuitive play patterns. Awards include the Parents’ Choice Award, KTVU’s Best of the Rest Education Toy Award and the National Parenting Center’s Seal of Approval.',

	description:'This English/Spanish learning radio teaches toddlers over 50 first words through interactive prompts, riddles, songs and music. I designed, user-tested and produced this best-selling toy, which has been translated for an international market.',
	challenge:"There was an immediate need to boost the LeapFrog 2009 toy line despite a dwindling budget and timeline. I was asked to take a preexisting product but revamp it with bilingual content teaching first words. To succeed, we needed a product that felt like a truly new experience rather than a rehash of old material.",
	strategy:'I spoke with education experts on how to foster bilingual word development and reviewed the current consumer products teaching first words. I learned that words are best taught in their environmental context & reinforced through multisensory exploration. No product on the market was doing this. So I designed the radio with environmental pages, catchy songs, clickable buttons and engaging lights that captured toddlers’ eyes, ears and hands. The best part? This redesign was really a re-skin of a previously made LeapFrog toy, keeping costs low.',
